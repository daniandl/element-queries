A modern approach to Element Queries using a ResizeObserver instead of relying on polling or user-interactions.
##### âš  Element Queries is in its early stages, I do not recommend using this in production yet.

## Installation

**Using NPM / Yarn**  
Use your favourite package manager to install `element-queries`.

```bash
$ npm install element-queries

$ yarn add element-queries
```

**Via script tag**  
You will find UMD bundles under the `dist/` directory. You can download the minified code and include it in your website's `<body>`.
 
Services like unpkg and jsDelivr can also be used, as long as you point to the correct file:  
**Unpkg:** `https://unpkg.com/element-queries@latest/dist/element-queries.min.js`  
**jsDelivr:** `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/element-queries@latest/dist/element-queries.min.js`  

(`ElementQueries` will be available under the `window` object)

<!-- ## Browser support -->

## Usage

Using Element Queries is easy, you can get going in three steps.  

**1.** First, start out by defining breakpoints on your HTML elements:

```html
<article class="post" data-eq-breakpoints="small: 300, medium: 600, large: 900">
  <img class="full-width" src="./img/post1-header.jpg" />
  <h2>My first post!</h2>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit...</p>
</article>

<!-- You can use whatever breakpoint names you like -->
<div data-eq-breakpoints="sm: 300, md: 600, lg: 900">...</div>

<!-- Change the attribute name via options -->
<div data-bps="xs: 300, sm: 600, md: 900">...</div>
```

**2.** Set up your breakpoints in your stylesheets. Your elements will be given a `data-eq-active` attribute, which you can match with CSS selectors.

```css
.post[data-eq-active="small"] h2 {
  font-size: .75rem;
}

.post[data-eq-active="medium"] h2 {
  font-size: 1rem;
}

/* You can change the attribute name via options */
.post[data-active-breakpoint="large"] h2 {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}
```

**3.** Finally, create an instance of ElementQueries in your JavaScript code and let the magic begin. You can also pass custom options via an object.

```js
import ElementQueries from 'element-queries' // if using npm

const eq = new ElementQueries()

// ...or pass in custom options
const eq = new ElementQueries({
  htmlAttrBreakpoints: 'data-eq-bps',
  htmlAttrActive: 'data-active-breakpoint',
  // full list below...
})
```

#### That's it!
You are now using element queries on your website, now go make it look pretty!

##### Using a framework or adding elements dynamically after page load?
Element Queries will detect these automatically as they are added and observe them as long as they have valid breakpoints.
<!-- This can also be disabled via options. -->

<!-- ## How it works -->

## Options
These are options you can pass as an object when creating a new instance of `ElementQueries`.

**Property**|**Description**|**Default**|**Version**
:--|:--|:--|--:
`htmlAttrBreakpoints`|(String) The name of the HTML attribute you would like to write your breakpoints in.|`data-eq-breakpoints`|![npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/-v0.3.0+-orange?style=flat-square)
`htmlAttrActive`|(String) The name of the HTML attribute that you will use in your CSS selectors.|`data-eq-active`|![npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/-v0.3.0+-orange?style=flat-square)

<!-- `observeDom`|(Boolean) Whether the plugin should watch the DOM for new elements to observe.|`true`|  -->

## API

### watch(element) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/-v0.3.0+-orange?style=flat-square)

* `element` {`HTMLElement`} A dom element you'd like to observe

Used to manually add an element to the observer. Must have valid breakpoints.

### update(elements) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/-v0.3.0+-orange?style=flat-square)

* `elements` {`Array`} Array of DOM elements

Force-update the given elements according to their internal state. You should not have to use this.

### destroy() ![npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/-v0.3.0+-orange?style=flat-square)

Disconnects the ResizeObserver and DOM observer. Also flushes the internal elements reference.

### Class `ElementQueries`

**Parameters**  
* `options` {`Object`} Object containing valid configuration options

**Properties**  
*These are for internal use only but you are welcome to play around with them (at your own risk)*
* `opts` a frozen options object
* `observer` contains the ResizeObserver
* `elements` a WeakMap containing all elements that have are still actively being referenced
